# Angular Express Train Seed

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/shtakai/Angular-Express-Train-Seed.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

This is a starting point for making AngularJS web applications with a node.js back end.  Here are some of the features:
- organized directories for both server side and client side
- basic user authentication using 401 responses from server
- data persistence using mongoose

Check out the demo site here: http://angular-express-train-seed.herokuapp.com/

Order you should learn this stuff, if you don't know it already:

1. AngularJS (http://angularjs.org/)
2. Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
3. Express (http://expressjs.com/)
4. Express Train (https://npmjs.org/package/express-train)

Since this app is using express train, start it by using the command 'train run'.  
You may need to install express train globally ('npm install -g express-train').
